A random Password Generator capable of using user inputs to randomly select a simple or complex password.

Please note: if you select a simple password, it will return only enough characters to equal the length the
user has requested.  If you select a complex password, it will double that length.

**update:**
Attempting to improve the functionality, so that it automatically displays the password inside a text box instead of an alert box.
